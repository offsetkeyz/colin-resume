<h1 class="title">Dear Hiring Manager,</h1>
<p class="author">Colin McAllister</p>

<p>Thank you in advance for considering my application for the Senior Developer position on the MDR Core team. I hope this letter serves to express my deep enthusiasm for this role, which aligns perfectly with my passion for automation, education, and security. This role resonates with my personal commitment to supporting both the detection development process and the security operations center. The opportunity to make a direct impact on Arctic Wolf’s core product is a responsibility I wholeheartedly embrace and find very fulfilling.</p>
<p>Having spent time in the Security Operations Center as an Engineer, as well as in a supportive role as a Business Analyst, and then transitioning to R&amp;D, I have developed an in-depth understanding of our product, pipeline, and operations. These experiences have been instrumental in shaping my approach to problem-solving, enhancing security solutions, and fostering collaborative relationships across teams. I am particularly passionate about mentoring and leading my team while continuing to grow and refine my skills, and I’m excited about the prospect of taking on greater responsibilities within our group.</p>
<p>Starting my Master’s in Cyber Security at SANS has been a game-changer for me. It has reignited my love for all things cybersecurity and is constantly feeding me new ideas and insights. The material I am learning is not just textbook theory; it’s real-world, practical knowledge that I can’t wait to bring to our projects. Plus, being a member of the GIAC Advisory Board allows me to interact with leaders in the community, gathering advice and knowledge from the best of the best.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am eager to bring my unique blend of skills, experience, and passion to the Senior Developer role in MDR Core. I am confident that my background, coupled with my deep understanding of Arctic Wolf’s culture and objectives, makes me a strong fit for this position. I look forward to the possibility of contributing even more significantly to a team and a company I deeply believe in. Thank you for considering my application.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Colin McAllister</p>
