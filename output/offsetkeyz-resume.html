<p>I am a people-first cybersecurity leader who believes that empowering
individuals through encouragement and constructive feedback is key to
fostering both personal and professional growth. My leadership approach
is hands-off, allowing my team the freedom to take ownership of their
work while providing the support they need to succeed. I tailor my
leadership style to each individual, ensuring that they feel valued and
confident, rather than forcing them to adapt to me. By focusing on clear
communication, collaboration, and a culture of trust, I create
environments where people can thrive and perform at their best. At
Arctic Wolf, I lead with the belief that happy, healthy, and productive
teams are the foundation of cybersecurity excellence.</p>
